# OpenBiomechanicsConstruction
This project is an exercise to reconstruct the human body via markers only. 

This involves making local and global coordinate systems 
Constructing joint segment COM and joint centers
Solving Joint Angles by looping through 3D tensors
plotting each segment from the lower extremities up the chain
